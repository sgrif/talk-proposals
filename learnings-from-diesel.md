Databases: What We Can Learn From Other Languages

Abstract
==

Learning new languages can broaden our horizons and help us think about problems
in different ways. This is even more true for frameworks. In this talk, we'll
take a look at Diesel, an ORM and Query Builder written in Rust. We'll compare
its similarities and differences to Active Record, and look at how its solutions
to some hard problems can be applied in our Ruby code.

In this talk you'll learn about how some of Active Record's internals work.
You'll also learn about common mistakes that Rails users make, and how to avoid
them. You don't need to know Rust for this talk, but you'll learn a bit of that,
too.
